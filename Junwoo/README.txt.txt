Direction for running the scripts:
The directory contains all contents required for running Project_main_JS.m file.

All reference pdf files are also included in the directory.


Notes on the scripts:

For filtering, Matlab with 2014a or higher version is required.
The Compartmentization is done with a-priori knowledge of the stimulus.
Three compartment is made: baseline, intense and poststimulus.
The spike detection algorithm uses median method.
